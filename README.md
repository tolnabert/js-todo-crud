# js-todo-crud

## 1. Create a server.js file:  

Set up an Express server.  
Define routes for getting, creating, updating, and deleting todos.  
Use `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.writeFileSync` to read and write data to a JSON file.  

## 2. Create a client.js file:  
Use `prompt-sync` to get input from the user. The input data has been validated.  
Make fetch requests to the server to perform CRUD operations on todos.  
Display the list of todos in the console.  

## 3. Implement CRUD operations:
- Create: Send a POST request to the server to create a new todo.
- Read: Send a GET request to the server to retrieve all todos.
- Update: Send a PUT request to the server to update an existing todo.
- Delete: Send a DELETE request to the server to delete a todo.

## 4. Handle errors: Implement error handling for both the client and server sides.
## 5. JSON data: Ensure that all data is formatted correctly in JSON.
## 6. User interface: While the client-side interface is simple, consider adding more features like filtering, sorting, and marking todos as completed.
